# Data-Analysis
 We're trying our data manipulation skills on a real-world dataset

We are free to decide what analysis and charts we want.

These are examples of what we could do.
• When do people order ?
• How many items do people buy ?
• What items sell the most ?
• How often do people order the same items again ?
• Which item do people put into the cart first ?
• What is the ratio of orders containing organic vs not organic ?
• How many unique products are offered in each department/aisle ?
• Is there an association between time of last order and probability of reorder ?

All those questions are answered on the model.

DATASET
This anonymized dataset contains over 3 million orders and 200k users from a grocery-delivery website.
Each users have from 4 to 100 orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
There is also the week and hour of day the order was placed and a relative measure of time between orders.
A product are inside aisles which themself are splitted into categories.
A Green Banana would be in the fresh fruits aisle which itself is part of the produce category.
